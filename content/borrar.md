Sure! The format you've provided is an **ISO 8601** timestamp, including:

* Date: `2025-06-07`
* Time: `15:01:26`
* Time zone offset: `+02:00` (2 hours ahead of UTC)

If you want to **get the current time** in this format or **convert a datetime to this format**, let me know your programming environment (e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.), and Iâ€™ll show you how.

For example, in **Python**, you can generate this format like this:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone, timedelta

# Define timezone offset
offset = timedelta(hours=2)
tz = timezone(offset)

# Get current time with offset
now = datetime.now(tz)
iso_format = now.isoformat()

print(iso_format)
```

Let me know what you're trying to do with this format!
